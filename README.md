# Apollo and GraphQL with Meteor

This is a repo following [Level Up Tutorial's Course](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/full-stack-graphql-with-apollo-meteor-and-react/graphql-queries-in-react) to try to get more familiar with GraphQL and Apollo.

Nothing earth shattering, but hopefully this will be a good example to look back on.:w
